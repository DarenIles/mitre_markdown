**Data from Removable Media**

Link: [T1025 - Data from Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1025)

Parent : [[Linux, Windows, macOS]]


# Description

Adversaries may search connected removable media on computers they have compromised to find files of interest. Sensitive data can be collected from any removable media (optical disk drive, USB memory, etc.) connected to the compromised system prior to Exfiltration. Interactive command shells may be in use, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) may be used to gather information. 

Some adversaries may also use [Automated Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119) on removable media.

# Tactics


[[Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to collect files from a system's connected removable media. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather data. Data may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001).]]
