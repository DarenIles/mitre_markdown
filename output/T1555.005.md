**Credentials from Password Stores: Password Managers**

Link: [T1555.005 - Credentials from Password Stores: Password Managers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/005)

Parent : [[Linux, Windows, macOS]]


# Description

Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.(Citation: ise Password Manager February 2019) Password managers are applications designed to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database. Credentials are typically accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database. After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. These databases can be stored as files on disk.(Citation: ise Password Manager February 2019)

Adversaries may acquire user credentials from password managers by extracting the master password and/or plain-text credentials from memory.(Citation: FoxIT Wocao December 2019)(Citation: Github KeeThief) Adversaries may extract credentials from memory via [Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212).(Citation: NVD CVE-2019-3610)
 Adversaries may also try brute forcing via [Password Guessing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/001) to obtain the master password of a password manager.(Citation: Cyberreason Anchor December 2019)

# Tactics


[[Consider monitoring API calls]]

[[ file read events]]

[[ and processes for suspicious activity that could indicate searching in process memory of password managers. 

Consider monitoring file reads surrounding known password manager applications.]]
