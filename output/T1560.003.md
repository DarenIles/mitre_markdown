**Archive Collected Data: Archive via Custom Method**

Link: [T1560.003 - Archive Collected Data: Archive via Custom Method](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/003)

Parent : [[Linux, Windows, macOS]]


# Description

An adversary may compress or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration using a custom method. Adversaries may choose to use custom archival methods, such as encryption with XOR or stream ciphers implemented with no external library or utility references. Custom implementations of well-known compression algorithms have also been used.(Citation: ESET Sednit Part 2)

# Tactics


[[Custom archival methods can be very difficult to detect]]

[[ since many of them use standard programming language concepts]]

[[ such as bitwise operations.]]
