**Cloud Storage Object Discovery**

Link: [T1619 - Cloud Storage Object Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1619)

Parent : [[IaaS]]


# Description

Adversaries may enumerate objects in cloud storage infrastructure. Adversaries may use this information during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including requesting all or specific objects from cloud storage.  Similar to [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) on a local host, after identifying available storage services (i.e. [Cloud Infrastructure Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1580)) adversaries may access the contents/objects stored in cloud infrastructure.

Cloud service providers offer APIs allowing users to enumerate objects stored within cloud storage. Examples include ListObjectsV2 in AWS (Citation: ListObjectsV2) and List Blobs in Azure(Citation: List Blobs) .

# Tactics


[[System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation]]

[[ but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities]]

[[ such as Collection and Exfiltration]]

[[ based on the information obtained. 
Monitor cloud logs for API calls used for file or object enumeration for unusual activity. ]]
