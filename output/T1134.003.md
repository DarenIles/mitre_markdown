**Access Token Manipulation: Make and Impersonate Token**

Link: [T1134.003 - Access Token Manipulation: Make and Impersonate Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003)

Parent : [[Windows]]


# Description

Adversaries may make new tokens and impersonate users to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, if an adversary has a username and password but the user is not logged onto the system the adversary can then create a logon session for the user using the `LogonUser` function. The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use `SetThreadToken` to assign the token to a thread.

This behavior is distinct from [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001) in that this refers to creating a new user token instead of stealing or duplicating an existing one.

# Tactics


[[If an adversary is using a standard command-line shell]]

[[ analysts can detect token manipulation by auditing command-line activity. Specifically]]

[[ analysts should look for use of the <code>runas</code> command. Detailed command-line logging is not enabled by default in Windows.(Citation: Microsoft Command-line Logging)

If an adversary is using a payload that calls the Windows token APIs directly]]

[[ analysts can detect token manipulation only through careful analysis of user network activity]]

[[ examination of running processes]]

[[ and correlation with other endpoint and network behavior.

Analysts can also monitor for use of Windows APIs such as <code>LogonUser</code> and <code> SetThreadToken</code> and correlate activity with other suspicious behavior to reduce false positives that may be due to normal benign use by users and administrators.]]
