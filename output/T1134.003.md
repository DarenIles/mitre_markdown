**Access Token Manipulation: Make and Impersonate Token**

Link: [T1134.003 - Access Token Manipulation: Make and Impersonate Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003)

Parent : [[T1134]]


# Description

Adversaries may make and impersonate tokens to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. If an adversary has a username and password but the user is not logged onto the system, the adversary can then create a logon session for the user using the <code>LogonUser</code> function. The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use <code>SetThreadToken</code> to assign the token to a thread.
