Parent : None


# Description

Adversaries may attempt to discover containers and other resources that are available within a containers environment. Other resources may include images, deployments, pods, nodes, and other information such as the status of a cluster.

These resources can be viewed within web applications such as the Kubernetes dashboard or can be queried via the Docker and Kubernetes APIs.(Citation: Docker API)(Citation: Kubernetes API) In Docker, logs may leak information about the environment, such as the environment�s configuration, which services are available, and what cloud provider the victim may be utilizing. The discovery of these resources may inform an adversary�s next steps in the environment, such as how to perform lateral movement and which methods to utilize for execution.
