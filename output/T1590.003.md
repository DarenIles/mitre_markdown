**Gather Victim Network Information: Network Trust Dependencies**

Link: [T1590.003 - Gather Victim Network Information: Network Trust Dependencies](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1590/003)

Parent : [[PRE]]


# Description

Adversaries may gather information about the victim's network trust dependencies that can be used during targeting. Information about network trusts may include a variety of details, including second or third-party organizations/domains (ex: managed service providers, contractors, etc.) that have connected (and potentially elevated) network access.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598). Information about network trusts may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Search Open Technical Databases](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1596)).(Citation: Pentesting AD Forests) Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595) or [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583) or [Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)), and/or initial access (ex: [Trusted Relationship](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199)).

# Tactics


[[Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate]]

[[ as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization]]

[[ making detection difficult for defenders.

Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle]]

[[ such as during Initial Access.]]
