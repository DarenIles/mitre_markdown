**Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Hardware Supply Chain**

Link: [T1195.003 - Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Hardware Supply Chain](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/003)

Parent : [[Linux, Windows, macOS]]


# Description

Adversaries may manipulate hardware components in products prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system. Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, network infrastructure, or peripherals.

# Tactics


[[Perform physical inspection of hardware to look for potential tampering. Perform integrity checking on pre-OS boot mechanisms that can be manipulated for malicious purposes.]]
