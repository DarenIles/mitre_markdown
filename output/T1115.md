**Clipboard Data**

Link: [T1115 - Clipboard Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1115)

Parent : [[Linux, Windows, macOS]]


# Description

Adversaries may collect data stored in the clipboard from users copying information within or between applications. 

For example, on Windows adversaries can access clipboard data by using <code>clip.exe</code> or <code>Get-Clipboard</code>.(Citation: MSDN Clipboard)(Citation: clip_win_server)(Citation: CISA_AA21_200B) Additionally, adversaries may monitor then replace usersâ€™ clipboard with their data (e.g., [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002)).(Citation: mining_ruby_reversinglabs)

macOS and Linux also have commands, such as <code>pbpaste</code>, to grab clipboard contents.(Citation: Operating with EmPyre)

# Tactics


[[Access to the clipboard is a legitimate function of many applications on an operating system. If an organization chooses to monitor for this behavior]]

[[ then the data will likely need to be correlated against other suspicious or non-user-driven activity.]]
