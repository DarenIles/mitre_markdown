**Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage**

Link: [T1567.002 - Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002)

Parent : [[T1567]]


# Description

Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a cloud storage service rather than over their primary command and control channel. Cloud storage services allow for the storage, edit, and retrieval of data from a remote cloud storage server over the Internet.

Examples of cloud storage services include Dropbox and Google Docs. Exfiltration to these cloud storage services can provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if hosts within the network are already communicating with the service.
