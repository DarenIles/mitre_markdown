**Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium: Exfiltration Over Bluetooth**

Link: [T1011.001 - Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium: Exfiltration Over Bluetooth](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1011/001)

Parent : [[T1011]]


# Description

Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over Bluetooth rather than the command and control channel. If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, an adversary may opt to exfiltrate data using a Bluetooth communication channel.

Adversaries may choose to do this if they have sufficient access and proximity. Bluetooth connections might not be secured or defended as well as the primary Internet-connected channel because it is not routed through the same enterprise network.
