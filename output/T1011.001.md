**Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium: Exfiltration Over Bluetooth**

Link: [T1011.001 - Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium: Exfiltration Over Bluetooth](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1011/001)

Parent : [[Linux, Windows, macOS]]


# Description

Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over Bluetooth rather than the command and control channel. If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, an adversary may opt to exfiltrate data using a Bluetooth communication channel.

Adversaries may choose to do this if they have sufficient access and proximity. Bluetooth connections might not be secured or defended as well as the primary Internet-connected channel because it is not routed through the same enterprise network.

# Tactics


[[Monitor for processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before. Processes that normally require user-driven events to access the network (for example]]

[[ a web browser opening with a mouse click or key press) but access the network without such may be malicious.

Monitor for and investigate changes to host adapter settings]]

[[ such as addition and/or replication of communication interfaces.]]
