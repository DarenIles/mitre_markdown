**Create Account: Local Account**

Link: [T1136.001 - Create Account: Local Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/001)

Parent : [[T1136]]


# Description

Adversaries may create a local account to maintain access to victim systems. Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service. With a sufficient level of access, the <code>net user /add</code> command can be used to create a local account. On macOS systems the <code>dscl -create</code> command can be used to create a local account. Local accounts may also be added to network devices, often via common [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as <code>username</code>.(Citation: cisco_username_cmd)

Such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.
