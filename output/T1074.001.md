**Data Staged: Local Data Staging**

Link: [T1074.001 - Data Staged: Local Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/001)

Parent : [[Linux, Windows, macOS]]


# Description

Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory on the local system prior to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as [Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560). Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.

Adversaries may also stage collected data in various available formats/locations of a system, including local storage databases/repositories or the Windows Registry.(Citation: Prevailion DarkWatchman 2021)

# Tactics


[[Processes that appear to be reading files from disparate locations and writing them to the same directory or file may be an indication of data being staged]]

[[ especially if they are suspected of performing encryption or compression on the files]]

[[ such as 7zip]]

[[ RAR]]

[[ ZIP]]

[[ or zlib. Monitor publicly writeable directories]]

[[ central locations]]

[[ and commonly used staging directories (recycle bin]]

[[ temp folders]]

[[ etc.) to regularly check for compressed or encrypted data that may be indicative of staging.

Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to collect and combine files. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather and copy to a location. Data may also be acquired and staged through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001).

Consider monitoring accesses and modifications to local storage repositories (such as the Windows Registry)]]

[[ especially from suspicious processes that could be related to malicious data collection.]]
