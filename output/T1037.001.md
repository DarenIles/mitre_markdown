**Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts: Logon Script (Windows)**

Link: [T1037.001 - Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts: Logon Script (Windows)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/001)

Parent : [[Windows]]


# Description

Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system.(Citation: TechNet Logon Scripts) This is done via adding a path to a script to the <code>HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript</code> Registry key.(Citation: Hexacorn Logon Scripts)

Adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. 

# Tactics


[[Monitor for changes to Registry values associated with Windows logon scrips]]

[[ nameley <code>HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript</code>.

Monitor running process for actions that could be indicative of abnormal programs or executables running upon logon.]]
